In this project, we utilize CGAN, WGAN, and attention mechanism to solve the ghosting artifacts occurred in multi-exposure images fusion with large motions.

## Get Started
### Prerequisites
 * Python 	      = 3.7.9
 * TensorFlow     = 1.15.0
 * Flask          = 1.1.2
  
### Setup
 * Clone this repo:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/Taichi-Pink/Attention-based-GAN-for-Large-Motions-in-Multi-Exposure-Images-Fusion.git
 cd Attention-based-GAN-for-Large-Motions-in-Multi-Exposure-Images-Fusion
 ```
 <!-- * Download data from [SICE dataset](https://github.com/csjcai/SICE). Place it under ```Dataset``` folder. Split the data in Dataset_Part1 into train (80%) and test (20%) set. -->

### Test
 ```
 python web_interface.py
 ```
